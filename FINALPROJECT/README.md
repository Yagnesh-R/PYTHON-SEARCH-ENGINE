PROJECT TITLE - PYTHON SEARCH ENGINE


PROJECT URL : https://youtu.be/onkI4nnunyo


DESCRIPTION : 
For the Final Project of CS50 of the Harvard-provided CS50 course, I developed this simple Python search engine. I collected all the Python-related questions and descriptions using the bs4 module and stored them in a mongo db. I then created the web application using HTML .A Python-based index-based search engine that uses information kept in an inverted index to discover solutions. Instead of going through each page list one by one, the search engine will scan the relevant index when a user inputs a search query to surface the closest matchingÂ result.
